# Logic of the Program
 As stated a class(Account) is made containing the attributes and different functions(methods). The class is made public so that it can be
 accessed. An array of objects is created for multiple entry of accounts. To access a particular account, the account no of the customer
 is asked and the requied task is performed on it. While to get the account no of a person, his/her name is written and all matching 
 entries are displayed in tabular form. There also a report option to display all the accounts along with their information in tabular 
 form. The CLI is made by using escape sequences and by flushing the screen multiple times through the loops. To keep the track of no of 
 entries a separate variable is used which increases its value as the create account option is accessed. The entrire code is writen in a 
 loop so that it can be accessed anytime without running the program multiple times. The code is written is c++ because it is handy,
 easily availble and easy to use...
